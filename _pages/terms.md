## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines
the types of personal information is received and collected and how it is used.

### Some General Information

Like many other websites on the internet this site is hosted on the
infrastructure of someone else and uses content delivery networks to provide
some of the used code. In my case the following providers are involved:
- [GitHub][gh-pages-policy] to host this site on GitHub pages
- [jsdelivr][jsdelivr-policies] as the cdn of my choice to get libraries
- [strato][strato-privacy] provides the mail servers and this domain

This site does not collect any data by its own. Only third party members are
collecting data to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security
and integrity of this Website and their services.

### Log Files

To maintain the security and integrity of this website the following
information are included in log files:
- Internet Protocol addresses (IP)
- Type of your used Browser
- Internet Service Provider (ISP)
- Date and time stamp
All of this information is not linked to anything that is personally
identifiable.

### Cookies

Currently this site doesn't give you any delicious cookies.

## Disclosure Policy

This site is completely ad-free! I make no money on this website.  
Currently I'm collecting no usage statistics, but this can change in future.

This site has some editorial content. I will always try to provide you the best
quality.

Despite careful control of the content, I assume no liability for the content of
external links. The maintainers of the linked pages are solely responsible
for their content.

Just like this website, these policies are a work in progress.  
As me evolve, so will this page.
